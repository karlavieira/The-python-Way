00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
To begin,
1

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,820
I want you to locate the day 1.2 debugging exercise.
2

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,380
And now, as you did before, go ahead and read through the instructions.
3

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,740
Be mindful that the output must match the example output precisely.
4

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,980
And when you hit run, this is the outcome you're looking for.
5

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,890
So there's quite a few things broken here,
6

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,130
but I want you to have a go at fixing each line individually and pulling out the
7

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,860
bugs from the code. So pause the video now and give that a go.
8

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,130
<v 1>All right.</v>
9

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,610
<v 0>So how did that go? If you haven't got your computer in front of you,</v>
10

11
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,350
if you're traveling, if somehow you can't access the exercise, just pause
11

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,790
and when you've got time,
12

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,430
then complete the challenge and then come back to the course.
13

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,300
It is so important that you actually do some hands-on stuff.
14

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,440
And I stress that this is the only way that you are going to become the rock
15

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,300
star coder that I know you can be. Let's take a look at the code below.
16

17
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,410
You can see that when we run our code as it is right now,
17

18
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,300
we get a new error.
18

19
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,650
And this is going to point to the first of many errors in this file.
19

20
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,930
And in this case, it tells us that on line three,
20

21
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,970
so this one right here, at around this position
21

22
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,740
or somewhere around here, um, as denoted by the little caret sign,
22

23
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,790
there is a syntax error. If we study this closely,
23

24
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,200
you can see that the code highlighting seems to be suggesting that all of this
24

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,060
is code, but this is somehow text. So what's going on here?
25

26
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,900
Well, notice that we've only got one double quote.
26

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,770
So it thinks that what comes after this is the text,
27

28
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,850
but what comes before it, it thought it was just a continuation of code.
28

29
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,500
So to fix this one,
29

30
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,530
all we have to do is add a double quote right here. That changes the text to the
30

31
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,010
color that we're used to and this fixes this line.
31

32
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,930
So if we run our code now, we should get a different error. And indeed we do.
32

33
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,580
The next one tells us that on line five,
33

34
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,720
so this one right here, there is an indentation error.
34

35
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,610
There's an unexpected indent somewhere around here on line five.
35

36
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,360
So let's take a look at line five and there you go.
36

37
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,280
There's a little bit of extra space between the print and the beginning of the
37

38
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,113
line.
38

39
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,240
So now that we've fixed that one, let's click run. And it will point to
39

40
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,910
another line of code that's broken. And in this case,
40

41
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,340
it says on line seven,
41

42
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,190
which is here where there's actually no code,
42

43
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,260
there's the unexpected EOF while parsing. What does this mean?
43

44
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,030
Well, if you're not sure,
44

45
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,060
then go ahead and paste it into Google and let's take a look at what people say
45

46
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,470
on Stack Overflow. So as this person,
46

47
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,970
very kind, Felix, um, has explained, this index error
47

48
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,110
unexpected EOF
48

49
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:16,030
while parsing means that the end of your source code was reached before all
49

50
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,650
code blocks were completed. What is a code block? Well,
50

51
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,920
this is a code block because it's a print function,
51

52
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,140
it has a beginning and it has an end. But what does this line not have?
52

53
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,690
Well, it's got two open parentheses,
53

54
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,630
but only one closing parentheses.
54

55
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,960
So the computer thinks that you are going to continue writing something and then
55

56
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,380
close it off at the end, which is not the case. In fact,
56

57
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,410
what has happened is we simply have an extra misplaced open parenthesis.
57

58
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,710
And now if we delete that and hit run,
58

59
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,520
you'll see that we have everything printed.
59

60
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,300
But at this point, notice how on line four
60

61
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,310
which is the line that we haven't fixed yet,
61

62
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,820
it prints string concatenation is done with the 'blank' sign.
62

63
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,430
Whereas in fact, it should say plus sign.
63

64
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,360
And even though we don't see any errors being printed in our console,
64

65
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,590
you'll see that we have an output mismatch because I'm expecting to see this
65

66
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,460
line, the String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign,
66

67
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,743
but here,
67

68
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,990
the output doesn't have that part. It's missing this part.
68

69
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,700
So there's one last thing that you need to debug. And that is of course,
69

70
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,630
on line four.
70

71
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,290
And what's happening here is we have this part being interpreted as a string,
71

72
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,540
this part being interpreted a string,
72

73
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,960
and it thinks that this plus sign is just us concatenating
73

74
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,280
these two parts together,
74

75
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,540
which is why it printed out like this. But in fact,
75

76
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,220
we wanted to print out is this as text down here.
76

77
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,850
So what we have to do is to change this outer apart from double quotes
77

78
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,320
into single quotes.
78

79
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,370
And now you can see when it highlights this part,
79

80
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,640
it's all the same color including the plus sign.
80

81
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,110
Now it sees this as a complete string,
81

82
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,850
and it's not looking at this as if it's code. So now if we run our program,
82

83
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,580
you can see the entire sentence being printed out.
83

84
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,650
So if you've completed the challenge and you've gotten everything right,
84

85
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,290
then you're now done with this exercise.
85

86
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,930
If you got stuck and you want to have a look at the solution, as always it's down
86

87
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,763
here,
87

88
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,040
and it might be useful to have a look at this page to see where you might've
88

89
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,620
missed something or where you might've gotten something wrong.
89

90
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,270
So I hope you enjoyed this code exercise. In the next lesson,
90

91
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,060
we're going to learn about a new type of Python function,
91

92
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,560
which is the input function. So for all of that and more, I'll see you there.
